# React Router Dom v6 Catch-All Route Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using catch-all routes (`/*`) in React Router Dom v6.  The catch-all route unintentionally overrides other routes, preventing them from rendering.

The `App.js` file contains the buggy code.  The `AppSolution.js` file provides the solution.
